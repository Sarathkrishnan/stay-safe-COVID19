                People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person
                through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or
                exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
                by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch
                COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
                This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

                WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                findings
