                Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone
                who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after
                someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges
                people to use masks wisely.</p>
            <p>
                WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use
                of masks <a

                The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
                hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3
                feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See <a
