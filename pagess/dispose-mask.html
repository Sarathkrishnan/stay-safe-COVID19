                <li> Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with
                    respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.</li>
                <li>
                    Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water</li>
                <li>
                    Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.</li>
                <li>
                    Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).</li>
                <li>
                    Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).</li>
                <li>
                    Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the
                    shape of your nose.</li>
                <li>
                    Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.</li>
                <li>
                    After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask
                    away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.</li>
                <li>
                    Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if
                    visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
            </ol>
